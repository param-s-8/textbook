There were three phases involved in making this possible. First, to create LTspice .asc files for solved and unsolved numericals in standard Electronic textbooks.

I lead the Front-End Team, and had fair contribution in backend strategies. Meeting & Training sessions were taken in order to 
teach about Django Web Development Framework, Bootstrap & other project related decisions. If need be, debugging, improvement & scaling of code is done.
